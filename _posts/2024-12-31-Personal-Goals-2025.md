# Old 2024 Goals:

## 0. Communal with Partner

This year is a milestone for us because we're going to finally get married. Besides that, we're also going to move in together and potentially even more cities! This year is full of change, so I think the biggest thing on my mind is to enjoy the time for what it is.

- [ ] Document enjoyable moments.

## 1. Health

- [ ] Reach a 45 VO2 max on Apple Watch or above. Currently, my VO2 max is at a steady 44, which is weird since I feel more fit than last year. It does make me think that Apple Watch has a strong bias based on age. Having a 45 be well within the "Above Average" rate seems good to me. Besides HIIT workouts, I think another major contributing factor this year will be doing more interval run trainings.
- [ ] Run another 10k and half marathon. This year was so fun, so why not aim for another one! This time, I'm hoping I can run under a 8 min mile pace for a 10k and beat my 8:19 half-marathon time. An important factor will be interval run training!
- [ ] Lose 10 lbs to a steady 160 lbs. I think this isn't unreasonable considering I have my own wedding coming up!
- [ ] Hit under a 100 in golf. Haha we'll see if this is possible.
- [ ] Take 1 hot-yoga class per month, or more. I think this will totally help me unwind from long runs and sweat out any drinking I do on weekends :p.

## 2. Professional

This year is a bit hard to figure out. On one hand, I'm still very much interested in having a career in research and potentially academia. On the other hand, I understand the challenges of finding a geographical location both my partner and I would live at, with sufficient pay with a fulfilling career. With that in mind, I set a few goals assuming my postdoc will come to an end towards the later half of this year.

- [ ] Finish my JMLR paper on causal discovery across multiple environments.
- [ ] Get MIGHT paper published and also the follow-on maximizing performance at sensitivity at 98% specificity for cancer detection paper. Fingers crossed both go somewhere super high impact.
- [ ] Finish scikit-tree development of hypothesis testing (via OSPO) and causal effect estimation (via VISS Schmidt Futures and OSPO).
- [ ] Write one new paper on causal inference related to either causal discovery, or causal representation learning.
- [ ] Finish series of PRs to add missing-value support for ExtraTrees in scikit-learn.
 
## 3. Misc. / Outreach / Societal Impact

- [ ] Schedule 5-6 blood donations this year.
- [ ] Maintain a greater than 600 day streak in Duolingo. Continuing this goal from last year. In addition, hope to schedule a number of lessons in Korean and Chinese before traveling to China/Korea this year!
- [ ] Read 2-3 books this year in my spare time at night. I think realistically, I will aim to read 2-3 new books this year instead of Netflixing at night.
