Summary: A short walkthrough of common interview questions.

Summary of interview questions

1. [Probability and Statistics]

It rains on saturday w/ 30% chance and sunday w/ 40% chance. What is the probability that it rains at least once over the weekend (i.e. Saturday and Sunday)? 

Say the event of rain is now correlated (i.e. not independent between sunday and saturday). Do we have any intuition on what is the range of probabilities possible for raining at least once over the weekend?

or alternatively

I eat pizza on saturday w/ 30% chance and sunday w/ 40% chance. What is the probability that I eat pizza at least once over the weekend (i.e. Saturday and Sunday)? 

What is the range of probabilities possible for eating pizza at least once over the weekend if eating pizza on Sunday is dependent on Saturday. Use inclusion-exclusion principle and bounds on the P(A \cup B) events given P(A) and P(B).

2. [Probability and Statistics + Coding]

You have a 52 card shuffled standard deck. You flip over cards and can stop at any point. You get $1 if a black card is flipped. You get $-1 if a red card is flipped. What is the optimal strategy and the expected value of the optimal strategy?

[Intuition 1] Realize that the expected profit at any point in time is a function of the current number of red and black cards.

[Intuition 2] Since you can choose stop at any time, you always have at least an expected value of 0 (i.e. playing the entire deck). Alternatively, if you get lucky and can flip over 26 cards, the maximum profit would be 26.

[Intuition 3] Since you can choose when to stop, you can choose to stop if your expected additional profit of playing is less than the additional profit of not playing. I.e. the additional profit of not playing is always 0 because you don't flip over a card. The additional profit of playing will then recurse down.

From this point on, you can write out a recurrence relationship to allow you to compute the
expected value starting from 26 R and B cards.

3. [Probability and Statistics - Coding]
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/999290/probability-brainteaser-expected-value-of-these-two-games

You can toss a coin 100 times or stop earlier, you are paid the percentage of heads of your tosses, estimate the upper bound of the value of the game.

[Intuition 1] The game is a function of the number of heads and number of tails seen. The baseline pay is H / (T + H), whereas the expected value of playing is a recursive function that can be computed given the boundary of H/100 being the payout when H + T == 100.

[Intuition 2] What is the stopping condition? Well you should "play" if the expected value of playing is greater than the expected payout of H / (T + H) at the current step. As a result, the optimal playing strategy is a function of your luck and the current state of the game.

Sample code solution:

```Python
def expected_value(T, H, n, memo):
    if T + H == n:
        return H / (T + H)

    if (T, H) in memo:
        return memo[(T, H)]

    val_if_play = 1./2 * expected_value(T + 1, H, n, memo) + 1./2 * expected_value(T, H + 1, n, memo)

    if T + H > 0:
        val_if_not_play = H / (T + H)
    else:
        val_if_not_play = 0

    memo[(T, H)] = val_if_play
    if val_if_play > val_if_not_play:
        return val_if_play
    else:
        return val_if_not_play


memo = dict()
memo_max = dict()
ev = expected_value(0, 0, 100, memo)
print(ev)
```

There is a gambling machine with n-slots. You put balls one-by-one into the machine, each ball has equal probability to get inside each slot. You can stop the game anytime. In the end you will be rewarded like this: for each 1-ball slot, you are rewarded $1; for each k-ball slot (k>=2), you are penalized $k; for each 0-ball slot you are rewarded nothing. What is your strategy? What is the expected value of the game?

```Python
def expected_value(r, e, n, num_balls, memo):
    if e == 0:
        return 0
    if num_balls - r - e >= 0:  # we threw too many balls already
        return 0
    if (r, e, num_balls) in memo:
        return memo[(r, e, num_balls)]

    p_empty = e / n
    p_single_to_k = r / n
    p_already_filled = (n - r - e) / n

    val_if_play = (
        p_empty * expected_value(r + 1, e - 1, n, num_balls + 1, memo)
        + p_single_to_k * expected_value(r - 1, e, n, num_balls + 1, memo)
        + p_already_filled * expected_value(r, e, n, num_balls + 1, memo)
    )

    # value if we don't play is equal to the 1-slots minus the number of extra balls we've thrown
    num_extra = num_balls - r
    val_if_not_play = r - num_extra

    memo[(r, e, num_balls)] = max(0, val_if_play, val_if_not_play)
    if val_if_play > val_if_not_play:
        return val_if_play
    else:
        return val_if_not_play


n = 100
memo = dict()
arr = [0] * n
ev = expected_value(0, n, n, 0, memo)
print(ev)
```

Flip a fair coin 100 timesâ€”it gives a sequence of heads (H) and tails (T). For each HH in the sequence of flips, Alice gets a point; for each HT, Bob does, so e.g. for the sequence THHHT Alice gets 2 points and Bob gets 1 point. Who is most likely to win?

Hint: First consider the expected value, and note that the expected number of points is
different from the probability of winning, where P(A wins) = P(A points > B points), and
P(B wins) = P(B points > A points).

Conceptually, consider the entropy of the game, and the fact that there are more states with
higher entropy (i.e. more combinations of a specific type, compared to another type).

Answer: Bob since there are more states in which Bob will win for a given sequence of flips.

b. Follow-up: What is the advantage that Bob has over Alice? I.e. What is the difference 
P(B wins) - P(A wins) for 100 flips? What about for n flips? Code it up.

Hint: As the number of flips increase, the advantage Bob has over Alice should decrease.

# Probability Brain Teasers

1. How many hershey kisses sold in USA last year?

Extrapolate starting from USA population: 330M. Now, we want to determine which subset
of the population would eat Hershey kisses, and which time periods of the year they would eat it.

- Population: Let's say people between ages 5-70 eat Hershey kisses because everyone else is too young or too old. This is maybe 80% of the population, so 0.8 * 330M = ~264M.

- Frequency: Let's say people eat Hershey kisses on average 1 time a week. This is 52 times a year. With double the amount during Halloween, Christmas, and Easter, we can say 52 + 3 * 52 = 208 times a year. 

Our final answer is somewhere around 208 * 264M, so more than 50B Hershey kisses sold in the USA last year.

1. Algorithm for approximating square-root of any number

Review Newton Raphson and setting up an equation, where the roots of the equation provide the solution.

Given "n", where we wish to approximate sqrt (n), we desire to find a number x, such that x^2 = n. Thus, let our function be f(x) = x^2 - n. If we find the roots of f(x), we have solved the problem. This now boils down to Newton-Raphson 0 finding for f(x). 

The recursive algorithm for Newton-Raphson is provide an initial guess x_0. 

x(n+1) = x(n) - f(x(n)) / f'(x(n)) = x(n) - (x(n)^2 - n) / (2x(n))

We can iterate until x(n+1) - x(n) < THRESHOLD, where the threshold is some precision we are interested in.

2. What is the probability of X > 0 given X + Y > 0, where X and Y are iid N(0, 1).

P(X > 0 | X+Y>0) = P(X > 0 | X> -Y) = 1 - P(X < 0 | X > -Y)

Now P(X < 0 | X > -Y) = P(X < 0 | X > -Y, Y > 0)P(Y > 0) + P(X < 0 | X > -Y, Y < 0)P(Y < 0). However, if Y < 0, then -Y > 0, and thus P(X < 0 | Y < 0, X > - Y) = 0. On the other hand, P(X < 0 | Y > 0, X > -Y) is symmetric around 0, such that P(X < 0 | Y > 0, X > -Y) = P(X > 0 | Y > 0, X > -Y). 

Thus P(X < 0 | X > -Y) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4

So our final answer for P(X > 0 | X+Y>0) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.

3. You are given a stock, which has an initial price of $100, i.e. r(0) = 100. Let r(1), r(2), r(30), denote the percentage difference in the stock price against the previous day. For example, if the stock price on day 1 is $110, then r(1) = 0.1 because it is 10\% higher than the previous day's price of $100.

If we know that the sum of all the returns $\sum_{i=1}^30 r(i) = 0$, then what can we say about the stock price on day 30?

- First, lower the dimensionality of the problem to 1, or 2 days. Note that if the return is 0.1 on day 1, it must be -0.1 on day 2 by the property that the sum of all returns is 0. Thus the final stock price on day 2 is $99. This is the case whether the returns start with -0.1 and then 0.1 on day 2. This pattern in general may hold?

- Let's see if holds in general: We can write down a pattern for the stock price as a function of the day. Let p(t) = stock price on day t, with p(0) = $100. Write down the recursive formulation.

p(t) = p(t-1) + r(t) * p(t-1)
p(t-1) = p(t-2) + r(t-1) * p(t-2)

=> p(t) = p(t-2) + r(t-1) * p(t-2) + r(t) * p(t-2) + r(t) * r(t-1) * p(t-2)

which gives rise to a recursive formula we can iterate until p(0):

p(t) = p(0) + \sum_{i=1}^30 r(i) * p(0) + \prod_{i=1}^30 r(i) * p(0)

By the assumption, we know that the summation term is equal to 0, so it can simplify to:

p(t) = p(0) + \prod_{i=1}^30 r(i) * p(0)

Note, we cannot say anything unless we know the sign of the \prod_{i=1}^30 r(i). It can be 0 if there is a day with return being equal to 0. This can be negative if there are an odd number of days with negative return. However, is that guaranteed?

For example, we could have a return of 0.4, -0.2, -0.2, 0.0, which sums up to 0, but also multiplies by 0, so the product is 0. If instead, 0.4, 0.1, -0.25, -0.25. We have actually that the product is positive. What if we consider six days? Say we have 0.4, -0.1, -0.1, -0.1, -0.1, 0.0, we have a product of 0. In addition, if we have 0.4, 0.1, -0.1, -0.1, -0.1, -0.2, we can have a product > 0. What about if we have three days? We can have 0.4, -0.4, 0.0, or 0.4, -0.1, -0.3. It seems that three days guarantees the product to be negative. What about five days? We have 0.4, -0.1, -0.1, -0.1, -0.1, which gives a positive product.

So in general, it is impossible to say anything about p(t) with respect to p(0) because we do not know the sign of the term \prod_{i=1}^30 r(i).

Online Assessment questions:
1. Given an integer n > 0, implement method to find the closest fibonnaci number to n:
    - direct: O(log(n)) solution by iterating through fibonnaci numbers until we reach n or higher; keep track of f_n, f_n-1 and f_{n+1}
        until f_{n+1} > n. Then return the closest of f_n and f_{n+1}.
    - Binet formula: golden ratio phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, then f_n = \frac{\phi^n - (1 - \phi)^n}{\sqrt{5}}.
        We can use this formula to find the closest fibonnaci number to n.
        We can also invert and approximate the answer by recognizing that one term will go to 0 as n goes to infinity.

2. Given array of strings, each string has a nested string like "key1.key2.key3.key4=value", implement

3. Build a class to do Linear Interpolation, with __init__ and __call__ functions. It will
interpolate between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) given a new x value.

The __call__(self, x) function will return the interpolated value at x. If outside range, return np.nan

y_interpolated = y1 + (y2 - y1) * (x_new - x1) / (x2 - x1) = "mx + b".

- estimate of lyapunov exponent: \sum_{i=1}^n \log |f'(x_i)| / n, where f'(x) = r - 2rx. We can monte carlo
estimate this value by averaging over many x_0 values within the range [0, 1].
- For each x value, we will monte carlo sample 100 instances to determine the lyapunov exponent andd whether 
or not it is positive.
