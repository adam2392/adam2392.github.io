Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at Columbia University in the Causal Artificial Intelligence Lab, directed by [Dr. Elias Bareinboim](http://causalai.net). I am an [NSF-funded Computing Innovation Research Fellow](https://cifellows2021.org/2021-class/). I did my PhD in biomedical engineering, specializing in computational neuroscience and machine learning at Johns Hopkins University. I worked with Dr. Sridevi V. Sarma in the [Neuromedical Control Systems group](http://sarmalab.icm.jhu.edu/). I also jointly obtained a MS in Applied Mathematics and Statistics with a focus in statistical learning theory, optimization and matrix analysis. I was fortunate to be a [NSF-GRFP fellow, Whitaker International Fellow](https://icm.jhu.edu/2017/03/20/adam-li-selected-for-nsf-graduate-research-and-whitaker-international-fellowships/#.YH2ZT6lKj0o), [Chateaubriand Fellow](https://icm.jhu.edu/2017/06/16/adam-li-icm-phd-student-selected-for-chateaubriand-fellowship/#.YH2Zi6lKj0o) and [ARCS Chapter Scholar](https://icm.jhu.edu/2020/07/20/adam-li-icm-phd-student-receives-arcs-scholarship/#.YH2ZbKlKj0o) during my time at JHU.

Research Interests
==================
My research interests are broadly in the intersection areas of neuroscience, statistical machine learning, causal inference, control theory and dynamical systems. I am also extremely passionate about open-source everything.

For a list of my publications, see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KxY17KcAAAAJ&hl=en). If there are any publications not publicly accessible, please shoot me a message and I'm happy to share with you.

Summary of Research Work
========================
My PhD thesis work focused on developing algorithms for seizure localization in drug-resistant epilepsy patients. I worked with multivariate time-series, such as intracranial EEG and scalp EEG data. I also did 2D and 3D image analysis with T1 MRI and CT scans of patients to understand the spatial relationships of epileptic networks. Specifically, I analyzed EEG data using dynamical systems, control theory, machine learning and statistics. I combined biological understanding of the brain with mathematical models of dynamical systems. I also utilized machine learning and statistical models to answer relevant hypothesis-driven questions, with a focus on learning manifold structure from a low number of samples. Moreover, I developed a suite of open-source software tools contributing to packages such as the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), MNE, The Virtual Brain (TVB), scikit-learn and other scientific packages.

My interest in engineering and medicine started at UCSD, where I graduated in 2015 with a double major in Bioengineering and Mathematics. It was there under the guidance of many great faculty, such as [Dr. Todd Coleman](http://coleman.ucsd.edu/), that I became interested in applied mathematics, data analytics and machine learning in healthcare. It led me to pursue a PhD, with the ultimate goal of bringing together technology expertise with biomedical domain knowledge to solve challenging medical problems.
